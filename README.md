* Allow users to swipe left and right to see different months
* Allow users to put a check mark on the days they went to the gym
* Allow user to see how many days in a row they have gone to the gym to date ( good )
* Allow users to share their calendars
* Allow users to follow other people’s calendars
* Allow users to see/follow other people’s workout/routine ( predefined routines ? )
* Allow users to get notified when the people they are following went or didn’t go to the gym (GPS?)
* Allow users to invite other users to a calendar (a group calendar)
* Allow users to superimpose friend’s calendar for a visual cue on schedule intercepts.  
* Allow users to create more than one calendar to track different goals ( I think this one would add unnecessary complexity to the app , it should be one calendar highly editable to let users manage workouts only)  
* Allow users to add a description to a calendar
* Allow users to add, delete, edit, and view a days workout plan.
* Allow users to checkmark a task when completed.
* Allow users to view a representation of task completed over total tasks ( percentage )
